Themes
======

This will be a short chapter! I have included two very different themes with Pastel:

1. **Skeuo**
2. **Feather**

_**You can change the theme in the footer just below.**_

The _Skeuo_ theme obviously plays on the term skeuomorphic UI. And while the theme doesn't include stitched leather just yet, some people prefer a more digital and light design, which is exactly what _Feather_ is. If you need to make a very customized design, it's probably a better starting point too.

Skeuo is the default (built-in) theme. If you want to change to feather you can either use the javacsript code I included in the demo or simply add the class _.feather_ to the _body_-element:

	<body class="feather">

I would love to see some custom designs, so **please** don't hesitate contacting me if you've made something nice!
